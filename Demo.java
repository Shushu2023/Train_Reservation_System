/* name:Shaima Nimeri
 * date:10-9-2023
 * purpose: a train reservation system
 * This class will serve to accept user input and manipulate the Reservation doubly linked list.
The Demo class should instantiate a Reservation object and display a menu to the user that will allow for the following actions:
Add a new passenger to the reservation system
Insert a new passenger after the passenger that is currently pointed
If a passenger is being added/inserted to an empty reservation list, that passenger should then be set to be the one that is currently pointed.
Print the contents of the reservation list
Display the current passenger (including name, phone, seat and cost)
When displaying the current passenger for the first time, the first passenger in the reservation list should be displayed.
To accomplish this, create a Passenger reference variable and assign it the first Passenger in the Reservation  
Cancel the current reservation (meaning that remove the current passenger).
Display a message that the reservation of that specific passenger is canceled.
When removing the current passenger, the new current passenger will be the passenger that directly follows the removed passenger.
Skip to the next passenger
If you are at the end of the reservation list, the next Passenger should be the first Passenger in the reservation list.
Return to the previous passenger
Exit
Validate the userâ€™s input for the menu option.  The user should be required to enter a valid menu option before advancing.
If any of the options chosen would not work due to there being no applicable passengers in the reservation list, an appropriate error message should be displayed.
The user should be allowed to repeatedly select menu options until they choose to Exit.
